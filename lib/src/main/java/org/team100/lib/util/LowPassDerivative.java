/**
 * We often need to find the derivative of some signal, e.g. given a series of
 * positional setpoints, derive the velocity for motor feedforward control.
 * 
 * The raw backwards finite difference amplifies the high-frequency noise in the
 * signal, causing lots of noise and effort in the motor.
 * 
 * This class combines a causal derivative with a causal low-pass filter, to
 * reduce the high-frequency noise.
 * 
 * NOTE! All causal low-pass filters introduce DELAY, because they necessarily
 * allow past measurements to affect the current one. You may want to experiment
 * with different combinations of cutoff frequency and delay, to see what works
 * best in your application.
 * 
 * There is a comparison of filtering approaches here:
